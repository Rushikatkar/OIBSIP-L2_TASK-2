                <b><em>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</em></b> was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim
                family in
                the

                forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi. Kalam was the youngest of four
                brothers and one sister in his family. His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and
                landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Even though his ancestors had been
                wealthy Marakayar traders, the family had lost most of its fortunes by the 1920s and was
                poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic found in coastal Tamil Nadu
                and Sri Lanka who claim descendance from Arab traders and local women. Their business had involved
                trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying
                pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban.
